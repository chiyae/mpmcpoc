- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a clean, modern, and readable interface. 
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying database schema.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for navigation and actions (e.g., plus for add, trash for delete, edit pen for edit). 
- Separate dashboards for Bulk Store and Dispensary with clear navigation.
